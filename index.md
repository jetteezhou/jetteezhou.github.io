## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. student jointly trained by <span class="highlight-company">Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)</span> and the <span class="highlight-company">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</span>. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Jinqiao Wang](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/homepage/jqwang/index.htm), Prof. [Honghui Dong](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8022/) and Dr. [Chaoyang Zhao](https://ia.cas.cn/rcdw/fyjy/202404/t20240422_7129867.html). 

Currently, I am a Research Intern at Tencent Robotics X Lab, working on the TAIROS project under the leadership of Dr. [Zhengyou Zhang](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BC%A0%E6%AD%A3%E5%8F%8B). 

My research goal is to build generalist agents capable of cognizing and interacting with the physical world. My primary research interests include:
- **Embodied Agent**: Embodied cognition, reasoning, and planning.
- **Multimodal Large Language Models**: Post-training alignment and Reinforcement Learning (RL).
