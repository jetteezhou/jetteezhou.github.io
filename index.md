## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student jointly trained at <span class="highlight-company">Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU)</span> and the <span class="highlight-company">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</span>, fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Jinqiao Wang](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/homepage/jqwang/index.htm), Prof. [Honghui Dong](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8022/) and Dr. [Chaoyang Zhao](https://ia.cas.cn/rcdw/fyjy/202404/t20240422_7129867.html).

My research bridges **Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI)** and **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**, focusing on enabling intelligent agents to perceive, reason, and act in dynamic physical environments. During my internship at <span class="highlight-company">Tencent Robotics X Lab</span>, I applied this research direction to the development of the **TAIROS embodied AI platform**. I aim to develop robust, generalizable AI & Robotic systems that can understand and interact with the world.

## Research Interests
- **Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI)**: embodied cognition, task planning, and decision-making
- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: SFT / RL post-training, and applications in EAI, such as multimodal reasoning.
