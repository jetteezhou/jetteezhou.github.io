## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student jointly trained at <span class="highlight-company">Beijing Jiaotong University</span> and the <span class="highlight-company">Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)</span>, fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Jinqiao Wang](https://nlpr.ia.ac.cn/iva/homepage/jqwang/index.htm), Prof. [Honghui Dong](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/8022/) and Dr. [Chaoyang Zhao](https://ia.cas.cn/rcdw/fyjy/202404/t20240422_7129867.html).

My research bridges <span class="highlight-research">Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI)</span> and <span class="highlight-research">Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)</span>, focusing on enabling intelligent agents to perceive, reason, and act in dynamic physical environments. During my internship at <span class="highlight-company">Tencent Robotics X Lab</span>, I applied this research direction to the development of the <span class="highlight-project">TAIROS embodied AI platform</span>. I aim to develop robust, generalizable AI & Robotic systems that can understand and interact with the world.

## Research Interests
- <span class="highlight-research">**Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI)**</span>: embodied cognition, task planning, and decision-making
- <span class="highlight-research">**Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**</span>: SFT / RL post-training, and applications in EAI, such as multimodal reasoning.
